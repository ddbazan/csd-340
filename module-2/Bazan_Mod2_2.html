        <h2>My Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro">I grew up in Dallas where the city was awake every night. My childhood was a rowdy one with my sister, my brother, my mother and I.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to spend time at the gym, playing games, or reading. These hobbies are ones that allow me to work on my social interaction outside of work.</p>
        <p>I am close with my family. My mother visits me every week and my siblings always push me to be better every day.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite memories is <span class="sentence">vacationing with my family to national parks, where we camped and went on long hikes.</span></p>
